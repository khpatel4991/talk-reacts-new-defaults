## Immediate Mode vs Retained Mode (Graphics Programming)

Immediate Mode

> Redraw the entire scene each time a new frame is required, regardless of actual changes.

Retained Mode

> Retain a model of the scene in memory. When changes occur, issue specific commands to change only the required parts.
